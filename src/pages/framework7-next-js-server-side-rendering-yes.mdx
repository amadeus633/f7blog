# Framework7, Next.js & Server-Side Rendering? Yes!

In [Framework7 v6 release announcement](https://blog.framework7.io/framework7-v6) we mentioned the full server-side rendering support. Now it is time for practice.

## TL;DR

You can fork this [\*\*framework7-nextjs-starter](https://github.com/framework7io/framework7-nextjs-starter)\*\* project right away and start hacking on it.

## Create Next.js Project

First, we need to create a new Next.js project. We will use `create-next-app` CLI tool. Run in terminal:

```
npx create-next-app f7-next-app
```

This command will create a project in a `/f7-next-app` directory.

## Install Framework7

Let's move to our project directory (`/f7-next-app`) directory and install required Framework7 dependencies. We need to install Framework7 itself, Framework7-React (as we develop a React app), Framework7 and Material icons:

```
npm i framework7 framework7-react framework7-icons material-icons
```

## Setup Environment Variables

In project root folder we need to create two `env` files:

- `.env.development` â€” with environment variables for development
- `.env.production` â€” with environment variables for production build

In this files we need to define `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST` variable, that will point to our webapp host. During development it will be `[http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000,) (default Next.js dev server), and for production you need to specify the host where the app will be deployed:

```bash
# .env.development
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
# .env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=https://my-framework7-website.com
```

## Routing

Before, we start hacking into our app files, let's figure out how to handle routing here.

Next.js has an amazing built-in router, but unfortunately it doesn't fit for complex page transitions used in Framework7. To solve this issues we need to use both Next.js (to get initial page component on server-side) and Framework7 (on client-side) routers.

To support server-side routing and have a correct response with initially requested page we must keep our pages in structure required by Next.js (e.g. in `./pages` folder). And we need to match our Framework7 router to this pages.

For example, if we have the following pages in our Next.js app:

- `./pages/index.js`
- `./pages/about.js`
- `./pages/blog/[postID].js` â€” dynamic route

We need to match it to Framework7 React router and pass this routes to our Framework7 App. So Framework7 routes for such structure will be the following:

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    asyncComponent: () => import('./index'),
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    asyncComponent: () => import('./about'),
  },
  {
    path: '/blog/:postID',
    asyncComponent: () => import('./blog/[postID]'),
  },
];
```

Pay attention that we use `asyncComponent` because we don't want (and more likely don't need) to add all routes/pages content into initial page JavaScript file.

## \_app.js

Now, let's move to our main app component. We need to setup and tweak our main App layout in `pages/_app.js` file. By default (created by `create-next-app`) it should look like this:

```js
import '../styles/globals.css';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

Let's modify it to the following:

```js
// Import Framework7
import Framework7 from 'framework7/lite-bundle';
// Import Framework7-React and components
import Framework7React, { App, View } from 'framework7-react';
// Next router
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

// Import icons and styles
import 'framework7/framework7-bundle.css';
import 'framework7-icons/css/framework7-icons.css';
import 'material-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css';
import '../styles/globals.css';

// Install Framework7 React plugin for Framework7
Framework7.use(Framework7React);

// App routes
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    asyncComponent: () => import('./index'),
  },
];

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // current Next.js route
  const router = useRouter();
  /*
    Here we need to know (mostly on server-side) on what URL user opens our app
  */
  const url = `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST}${router.asPath}`;

  return (
    /*
      Here we pass initial server URL and routes to the Framework7's App.
      It is required because Framework7 will be initialized on server-side,
      and we need to know this URL to correctly load pages by Framework7 router
    */
    <App url={url} routes={routes}>
      {/*
        Create main View.
        Apparently we need to enable browserHistory to navigating by URL
      */}
      <View
        main
        browserHistory
        browserHistorySeparator=""
        browserHistoryInitialMatch={true}
        browserHistoryStoreHistory={false}
        url="/"
      >
        {/*
          Initial page components (returned by Next.js).
          Here it is mandatory to set `initialPage` prop on it.
        */}
        <Component initialPage {...pageProps} />
      </View>
    </App>
  );
}
```

## index.js

We are almost ready. What is left is to change our main index page (located in `index.js` ) to be a Framework7-React page:

```jsx
import { Page, Navbar, Block } from 'framework7-react';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Page>
      <Navbar title="Framework7 Next.js" />
      <Block>Hello world from Next.js</Block>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

## Launch ðŸš€

Now, let's launch our dev server

```
npm run dev
```

And we should see something similar to this on `http://localhost:3000`

![](/images/framework7-next-js-and-server-side-rendering-yes-0.png)

But was it rendered on server-side? Let's check response source code:

![](/images/framework7-next-js-and-server-side-rendering-yes-1.png)

Great, as we see server-side rendering works.

## Navigation

As mentioned above for navigating and router we use ONLY Framework7's router, its methods and components.

Let's create dynamic route page in `./pages/blog/[postID].js` file with the following content:

```jsx
import { Block, Navbar, Page } from 'framework7-react';

export default function BlogPost(props) {
  /* 
   we use Framework7 router and its features
  */
  const { postID, f7route } = props;
  return (
    <Page>
      <Navbar title="Post" backLink="Back" />
      <Block strong>
        <p>
          This is a dynamic route loaded from <code>/blog/[postID].js</code>{' '}
          page component.
        </p>
        <p>
          Route URL: <b>{f7route.url}</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Post ID: <b>{postID}</b>
        </p>
      </Block>
    </Page>
  );
}
```

And now we need to add this route to our Framework7 routes in `_app.js` :

```jsx
// ...

// move our routes array out of component
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    asyncComponent: () => import('./index'),
  },
  // add dynamic Framework7 route to ./blog/[postID].js page
  {
    path: '/blog/:postID',
    asyncComponent: () => import('./blog/[postID]'),
  },
];

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // ...
  return (
    <App url={url} routes={routes}>
      {/* ... */}
    </App>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

And link to the page, somewhere on our home page:

```html
<a href="/blog/45">Blog post</a>
```

Everything works as intended:

<iframe
  loading="lazy"
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h1FpBBkF0cw"
  allowFullScreen
/>

## Bonus: Server-Side Theme Detection

As you may know Framework7 supports iOS, Material Design and Aurora themes. Theme can be specified on main App component like so:

```jsx
<App theme="ios">
```

Or it can be set to `auto` and Framework7 will decide which theme to use based on user device. And if we use server-side rendering, it is not recommended to use `auto` theme senselessly.

For example, we set theme to `auto`, and user visits our web app with iOS device. Framework7 will be initialized on server-side, and apparently it will not detect server environment as iOS device and will enable `material` theme. Then on client side, it will detect it as iOS device and set theme to `ios` , but HTML layout rendered on server-side can be different (the one that required for `material` theme), which can produce as server-client layouts will not match.

Simple solution will be to just use single theme. But that is not for us. With Next.js `getInitialProps` we can actually correctly detect user's device on server-side based on his `user-agent` !

To do so, let's add `getInitialProps` function to our `_app.js` and see how get and use user-agent:

```jsx
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, userAgent }) {
  // pass userAgent to Framework7's App component
  return (
    <App url={url} routes={routes} userAgent={userAgent}>
      {/* ... */}
    </App>
  );
}

MyApp.getInitialProps = async ({ ctx }) => {
  // get user-agent string on server-side
  if (ctx && ctx.req && ctx.req.headers) {
    // pass it to our component props
    return {
      userAgent: ctx.req.headers['user-agent'],
    };
  }
  return {};
};

export default MyApp;
```

Now, theme detection will work correctly and we can safely use condition rendering even on server-side, e.g.:

```jsx
import { Page, Navbar, Block, theme } from 'framework7-react';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Page>
      <Navbar title="Framework7 Next.js" />
      <Block>
        {theme.ios && <p>Hello to iOS user!</p>}
        {theme.md && <p>Hello to Android user!</p>}
      </Block>
    </Page>
  );
}
```
