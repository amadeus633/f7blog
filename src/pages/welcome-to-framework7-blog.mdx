# Welcome to Framework7 Blog

Hi!

As title says welcome to Framework7 blog. I and, probably, other Framework7 developers will post here new tutorials, information about new releases, new features and news from Framework7 world.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
);
